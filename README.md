## About The Project

Disaster-Guard is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Celo blockchain. This platform allows users to report and manage disaster information, enabling the community to view, report, and manage disaster data effectively. Built on a robust smart contract, Disaster-Guard ensures transparency and reliability in managing critical disaster information. The following functionalities were integrated:

### Features included:

- A function that allows users to submit disaster reports with detailed information.
- A function to retrieve disaster reports by index, returning all the details of a specific disaster report.
- A function to delete disaster reports. Only the original reporter can delete their reports.
- A function that allows reporters to add images to their disaster reports.
- A function to retrieve all images associated with a specific disaster report by its index.
- A function that allows the reporter to delete specific images from their disaster report.

<!-- TESTING APP -->

To properly test the dapp you will need to have a Celo wallet with testnet tokens.
This learning module [NFT Contract Development with Hardhat](https://hackmd.io/exuZTH2hTqKytn2vxgDmcg) will walk you through the process of creating a Metamask wallet and claiming Alfajores testnet tokens.
